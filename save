Push swap has at his disposal 2 stacks and the following instructions :
* `sa / sb / ss`      Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a / b / both.
* `ra / rb / rr`      Shift up all element of stack a / b / both by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
* `rra / rrb / rrr`   Shift down all element of stack a / b / both by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
* `pa / pb`           Take the first element of a / b and put it at the top of the other stack.

At start a represent the integers given and b is empty, at end integers must be sorted on a.
